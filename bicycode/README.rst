This module adds a bicycode field on stock move lines.
These bicycodes are used to identify bicycles after production and add traceability to the bicycles.

Products have a new field to define whether they have a bicycode or not.
Picking types have a new field to define whether their pickings require a bicycode for the products that have a bicycode.

When a picking with bicycode required is done, the user must input the bicycode of the products that have a bicycode. 

Bicycode are searchable from the Inventory > Configuration menu.
